HOW DOES WEB BROWSER WORK?
-->A browser is a software application used to locate, retrieve and display content on the World Wide Web, including Web pages, images, video and other files. 
As a client/server model, the browser is the client run on a computer that contacts the Web server and requests information. 
The Web server sends the information back to the Web browser which displays the results on the computer or other Internet-enabled device that supports a browser.

-->Todayâ€™s browsers are fully-functional software suites that can interpret and display HTML Web pages, applications, JavaScript, AJAX and other content hosted on Web servers. 
Many browsers offer plug-ins which extend the capabilities of the software so it can display multimedia information (including sound and video), or the browser can be used to perform tasks such as videoconferencing, 
to design web pages or add anti-phishing filters and other security features to the browser.

                    }
Format--------->   Initialization, condition checking, iteration statement 
                    are written at the top of the loop.
